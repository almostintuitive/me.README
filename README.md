# Motivation

I'm a co-founder at Drops, and I personally feel responsible for all technical aspects of what we do.

My personal goal is to create disproportionate amount of value with my work.
My goal with the team is to crate an environment where we can all do the same.


# 1on1s

We'll have a 30 minute 1on1 every week, where ideally we discuss personal issues and your subjective experience of the week.
The sessions will be varied, sometimes I'll bring questions, sometimes I'll try to create a more natural conversation flow.


# Reviews

We'll have reviews every 3 months.
These are more formal than 1on1s, and usually include my co-founder, Daniel (if he's available).
I'll ask a few standard questions, and we'll give you feedback on your past 3 months contribution and try to offer guidance on what to do next.


# Communication

I'd like you to raise issues anytime when you encounter them:
If you're blocked, scream.
If you're stuck, start a conversation.

I believe we'll need to communicate with each other actively to resolve issues, rather than working on them in isolation.
I really like frequent status updates, either on chat or via pull requests / tickets.
I think this is essential for working together effectively.


# Work time

You can ping me any time on Slack, I'll usually reply quickly.
Sometimes I work on the weekend / evenings. Iâ€™ll try to not to mention anyone outside of working hours. You can mention me anytime.
If I do need your attention in extraordinary circumstances, I'll make this explicit.
Please if you are in a similar situation, do the same.


# Ways of thinking

As we're building a small, but super-capable team, we ended up using a few technologies that may seem risky, but they helped us in either one or all these aspects:
- finding the right level of abstraction (react-native)
- minimize state and therefore maintenance (serverless)
- democratize information rather than building silos (typescript everywhere)
These are the principles I'd like to apply to any future technical decisions as well. 

I'll encourage everyone to find elegant, simple solutions to technical or product problems.
I understand that this may not be always possible, but I'd rather have a simple, reusable system that covers 90% of the use cases, and have hacks supporting the other 10% rather than creating a complex system upfront, that covers everything.
According to my experience, a simple system with hacks is usually more more easy to correct and generalize later than reducing existing complexity.

I prefer everything to be continuous, let that be design, refactoring, or feature development.

I think unnecessary and/or distributed state is evil, and is the source of most structural issues in software development.


# Opinion

I follow the "strong opinions, weakly held" principle.
Feel free to challenge me on anything, from technical issues to management style.
I think this will bring all of us forward, even if you feel some impatience in my voice.


# My weaknesses

I'm impatient by nature.
That does not mean you'll always experience my impatience - I can control ot most of the time.
When for some reason I do not, bear with me. Help us move forward, and you'll see my regain my balance.

Sometimes I can be impulsive, and contradict my previous recommendation.
I'd really appreciate if you flag this. These usually result in very useful conversations.

My humor is mostly on the sarcastic side.
I hope I do not come across cynical when we're talking about anything serious. It's much appreciated if you flag if I do.
